## Abstract 

This was a Turing School of Software and Design paired-project. The focus for this project was to gain a better understanding of React. Using both functional and class based components, we created a movie rating/information app that allows users to search films based on 3 criteria, view more specific information on a particular movie, and watch trailers if available. We gained a deeper understanding of async functionality, prop passing, state, and other functionality within React. You can find the original project specs [HERE](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html).

## Future Additions
